In this folder we have 'ideal_sample_docs' and 'old_docs'. We open up cmd inside either of these folders, then run 'docbuild --pdf' or whatever command you want is, and it will produce the correct output. 'old_docs' is the original sample docs that Khushboo made, and are working with docbuild perfectly. ideal_sample_docs has updated the file structure of the old files to be a bit more organised. But there's a problem with this, for some reason (and I think it's definitely something completely out of our control), puppeteer/md-to-pdf kicks up a fuss when there are two+ files in a directory that start with a number. It's completely fine with letter-only names, but this isn't much use to us. So the ideal_sample_docs folder will not work when its passed through docbuild. We eventually need to get to a point where it will be able to work, and our most-likely work-around at the moment is that Cian is working out how to pass a number of MD files together in one go, as opposed to individual files, so hopefully this will resolve it.
